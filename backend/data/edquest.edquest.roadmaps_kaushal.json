Your task is to create a simple user registration form that includes validation for user input such as email and password fields. You'll learn about managing state in forms, different techniques for validating user input, and common use cases for forms in mobile applications.\n\nExample: Build a user registration form that includes fields for Name, Email, and Password. Ensure that the Email is validated to be in the correct format and that the Password meets minimum security requirements (e.g., at least 8 characters long).",

You will explore various techniques for data cleaning including handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization. Additionally, you will understand why using a test-train split is essential for building robust machine learning models. You will implement data cleaning and splitting using Scikit-Learn in Python.\n\nFor example, you might start with a dataset that has missing values and outliers, perform necessary cleaning techniques (such as imputation and normalization), and finally split your cleaned dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate your ML models effectively. \n\nYou can find the relevant dataset and instructions on this GitHub link: [GitHub Dataset](https://github.com/your-repo/dataset) where you can download the necessary files and find sample code.",

You will learn about the fundamentals of REST APIs, set up your Flutter project, and integrate API data into the UI. By the end of this task, you should be able to build a simple application that fetches and displays data from a public API. You can use the 'jsonplaceholder.typicode.com' as a source for fetching mock data. Make sure to explore topics such as what REST APIs are, how to configure Flutter for HTTP requests, and how to display data in a Flutter application. This will enhance your skills in working with web services and handling data asynchronously in Flutter.",
